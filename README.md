- 👋 <h1>Hello!I am Christelle </h1>
- 👀 UI/UX Designer with a combined experienced in communication, project management, customer support, leadership and other related skills, i am passionate about the creation of app content, and improving the design of already existing apps. This could be NGOs apps and websites and any other types of businesses.

work on an NGO app for women’s reintegration, a cleaning services booking app, and a
mobile app for recharging electric vehicles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any innovative project that is user-centered designed.
